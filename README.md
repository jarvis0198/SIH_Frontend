# 📦 React App – Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a powerful starting point for building modern single-page React applications.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### 🔧 `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload automatically when you make edits, and any lint errors will show up in the console.

### 🧪 `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Learn more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### 📦 `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.  
The output is minified and includes hash-based filenames for caching.

### ⚠️ `npm run eject` (Advanced)

**Warning:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!

This command removes the single build dependency (`react-scripts`) and copies the configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over the build setup.
